# SimpleQuest — Agent Instructions

Shared homelab dev conventions first, then project-specific detail.

<!-- baseline:start -->
## Homelab dev environment

This repo runs on the homelab dev server, not a laptop.

- **Running it:** the dev server is a container in the `personal-projects` stack
  (`~/projects/docker-compose.yml`), viewable LAN/Tailscale-only at `<host>.maitz.casa`.
  Do NOT run the dev server as a raw host process — the host firewall (nftables,
  default-deny) drops arbitrary ports; only Traefik's 80/443 are open. Restart after a
  config change: `docker compose -p personal-projects restart <service>`.
- **Package manager:** npm — pinned via `packageManager` in package.json. Don't switch
  managers or mix lockfiles.
- **Node 20** (`.nvmrc`) — matches the container runtime; install under it to keep native
  modules ABI-compatible with what the containers run.
- **Secrets:** never read, print, or echo `.env` / key / token *values* — diagnose from
  variable names and metadata only. `.env` is gitignored; never stage it.
- **Remote:** GitHub-only (`origin`); PRs via `gh`.

# SimpleQuest

An RPG HUD web component (SolidJS + `solid-element`, custom element `<simple-quest>`).
Consumed as a module by the `tactical-rpg` game app, which wraps it in `simplequest-hud`.

- **SolidJS everywhere** — never React. Use signals/effects; don't destructure props at the top level.
- Web-component authoring: attributes may arrive after DOM insertion — handle empty initial
  attributes and re-init on `attributeChangedCallback`.
